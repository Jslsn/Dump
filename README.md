# Golden Age :sunrise_over_mountains: :crossed_swords:

This is where I recreate parts of or similar things(Barring the Web Deployment) to projects I've worked on in the past.

## Web Deployment

This is something I created to show off what I knew, it was fun :smiley:


## Bash Scripts

Various bash scripts I've created across my time using them, some recreated, some completely random ones.


## Next

There's a few more things I'll need to recreate, some from years back, particularly around my usage of serverless and some Python scripts.
