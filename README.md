# Golden Age :sunrise_over_mountains: :crossed_swords:

This is where I recreate parts of or similar things(Barring the Web Deployment) to projects I've worked on in the past.

## Web Deployment

This is something I created to show off what I knew, it was fun :smiley:


## Bash Scripts

Various bash scripts I've created across my time using them, some recreated, some completely random ones.

## Serverless Functions

Serverless functions I've made in the past, most will be in AWS SAM.

## Next

There's a few more things I'll need to recreate, some from years back, probably some more around my usage of serverless and potentially a Python script.
