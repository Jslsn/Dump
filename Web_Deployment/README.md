# Jordan's basic Web Deployment

This is a basic site, I've designed it with availability, fault tolerance, and security in mind. Redeployability and making it something that can be easily modified for said redeployments are also things I've taken into consideration(At least in later updates).

## For Deployment

### Requirments

None right now! Just Terraform :)

### Deploying
To Deploy:
- Run a terraform init in the terraform directory.
- In the same directory, run terraform apply.
